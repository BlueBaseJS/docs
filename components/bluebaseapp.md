# BlueBaseApp ðŸ“Œ

The main BlueBase app. This is the top level component that takes care of initialisation, and renders either children, or it's own views with routing.

As BlueBaseApp is just a react component, it is possible for 

{% hint style="info" %}
#### System Component ðŸ“Œ

This component is shipped with BlueBase Core.
{% endhint %}

## Usage

```jsx

        hooks={{ /* Hooks Collection */ }}

    />
);
