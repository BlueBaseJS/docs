# 2. Create Screens

After creating a new plugin, you can view the project architecture with different folders. Source folder contains all the source code files of the plugin which will be presented in our application. For our shopping application, we will create following screens:
1. Product listing screen
2. Product detail screen

Source folder will include folder of screens. In screens folder:
1. Create a new file named "ProductsList".
2. Design the screen using bluebase base components like cards to display products in the form of list.
