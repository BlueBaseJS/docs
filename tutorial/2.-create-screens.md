# 2. Create Screens

Following the project architecture, source folder contains all the source code files of the feature (plugin) which is to be displayed. Source folder will include folders of screens, components, hooks, routes etc. In screens folder, we will create a new file giving it a meaningful name and can create as many screens as we desire. For instance, below image illustrates the folder structure for screens:
