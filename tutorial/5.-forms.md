# 5. Forms

Forms provide a way to allow users to interact with the application to fill input fields required so that further process can take place on the provided data. Source folder contains the folder for forms where we can add different forms depending on different fields required. Below example illustrates a thing name form in forms folder:

This name form includes thing name and thing status fields using a JsonGraphqlForm which is a basic bluebase component and will ask user to fill the required fields.
