# 1. Create a Backend API

We will need to create a backend graphql API (Application Program Interface) for our shopping site in order to respond to user requests. An API endpoint is required to access resources from the backend to carry out functions in our application. User interacts with the application and send requests through these endpoints and gets response from the server. Following are the steps to create a backend API:

**1.** Signup on GraphCMS to create a GraphQL API.

**2.** Create a new project by selecting "Commerce Starter" from templates.

**3.** Enter name and description, keep "Include template content" checked.

**4.** Choose your location and press "Create Project".

**5.** On "Please choose a plan" dialog, select "Free Forever" and press "Continue".

**7.** On Schema editor, you can view a predefined schema for a shopping site having different models with multiple fields. You can also add models and fields as per your requirement.

**11.** In order to get API endpoint to integrate in your project, move to settings and choose the option "API Access". A URL will be provided under "Endpoints" which will allow you to access the data through your app.

**12.** Copy the URL and paste it in bluebase.ts file in your project's directory bluebase folder where Apollo Graphql Configs are set.
