# ðŸ”¥ Hot Module Replacement

BlueBase features Hot Module Replacement out-of-the-box, and requires no additional configuration.

On web, we use [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and [webpack-hot-client](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-client), while react-native has built-in support.
