# ðŸŽ£ Hooks

Hooks are the backbone of BlueBase. They allows us to modify data or inject custom logic in any part of the application at runtime.

A hook can be [registered](hooks.md#registering-a-hook) by one of the methods listed below. At runtime, when a hook event is executed, each registered hook is run in the order of _priority_, and given the opportunity to modify a value by returning a new value.

BlueBase provides different lifecycle hooks to the application, but a plugin may define its own hooks as well.

## API

Each hook event can have multiple hooks registered in BlueBase. These hooks are executed in a waterfall sequence, where result of each listener is passed on to the next one.

### Properties

Each hook has the following properties:

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `key` | _string_ | The key is used as an ID. |
| `event` | _string_ | This is the name of event to hook into. |
| `priority` | _number_ | _\(optional\) \(Default = 10\)_ At runtime each hook is executed based on the priority with the lowest number running first and highest running last. |
| `value` | _function_ | This is the handler function that is called when a hook is executed. This function maybe an async function that resolves a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Details of handler function are given [below](hooks.md#listener-handler). |

### Handler function

This is the function that is executed at runtime. Handler functions in BlueBase maybe async functions, i.e. functions that return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolve a value.

Each handler function receives 3 arguments during execution:

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `value` | This is the main value that is being hooked into. A hook expects this value to be returned. If the value is changed during execution, the next listener will receive the new value instead of the original version. |
| `args` | An object that may provide addition context or information of the event. |
| `BR` | BlueBase context. |

## Hook Collections

In BlueBase multiple hooks can be registered for multiple events at once. We do this through the `HookNestedCollection` data structure.

A `HookNestedCollection` is an object that has key-value pairs. Each property is a string that represents the hook event name. And the value of this property can be one of the following:

1. [A hook object](hooks.md#hook-object)
2. [A handler function](hooks.md#handler-function-1)
3. [An array of containing hook object and/or handler functions](hooks.md#array-of-hooks)

Moreover, the collection itself can be a:

1. A `HookNestedCollection` object
2. [A function \(thunk\) that returns a `HookNestedCollection` object](hooks.md#thunks)

### Hook Object

Hooks can be added to the collection as objects. When defining a hook as an object, keep in mind that both `key` and `value` are required properties.

```javascript
const MyHookCollection = {
    'hook.event': {
        key: 'hook.listener.name',
        priority: 5,
        value: async (value, args, BR) => {
            // your hook logic here

            return value;
        }
    }
};
```

### Handler Function

There is also a much simpler shorthand version. Rather than setting the whole listener object, the handler function can be set directly. In this case, BlueBase will attempt to auto-generate a hook key.

```javascript
const MyHookCollection = {
    'hook.event': async (value, args, BR) => {
        // your hook logic here

        return value;
    }
}
```

### Array of hooks

It is also possible to add more than one hooks for each hook event. Rather than creating a single hook, just create an array instead.

Note that the array items can either be a hook object or a handler function.

```javascript
const MyHookCollection = {
    'hook.event': [
        {
            key: 'hook.listener.name',
            priority: 5,
            value: async (value, args, BR) => {
                // your hook logic here

                return value;
            }
        },
        async (value, args, BR) => {
            // your hook logic here

            return value;
        }
    ]
};
```

### Thunks

BlueBase also supports Hook Collection thunks. Which means, a Hook Collection can be a function that returns `HookNestedCollection` object.

This function receives BlueBase context object as the only argument at execution time.

```javascript
const MyHookCollection = (BR) => ({
    'hook.event': async (value, args, BR) => {
        // your hook logic here

        return value;
    }
});
```

## Registering a Hook

There are three ways to register to a hook listener is BlueBase.

1. [Register a hook through Plugin](hooks.md#register-a-hook-through-plugin)
2. [Register a hook through `hooks` property in `bluebase.js` file](hooks.md#register-a-hook-through-hooks-prop-in-bluebase-js-file)
3. [Register a hook through HookRegistry API](hooks.md#register-a-hook-through-api)

### Register a hook through Plugin

The easiest way to register a hook is through the `hooks` property in the plugin. This property expects a [HookNestedCollection](hooks.md#hook-collections) object.

```typescript
const MyPlugin = {
    hooks: {
        'hook.event': {
            key: 'hook.listener.name',
            priority: 5,
            value: async (value, args, BR) => {
                // your hook logic here

                return value;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Register a hook through hooks prop in "bluebase.ts" file

Hooks can be registered directly in `bluebase.ts` as well. Just create a hooks property in the main BootOptions object. Like plugins, this property is also expected to be a [`HookNestedCollection`](hooks.md#hook-collections).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The hooks added directly to the hooks property in `bluebase.js` are registered before any other code execution during boot. This means, that they have to ability to override some core internal process \(including the boot logic itself\).

This is not possible through plugin hooks, as they are registered and executed much later in execution.

For this reason, use this with caution. Unless extremely necessary, it is best to just register hooks through plugins.
{% endhint %}

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="bluebase.js" %}
```javascript
export default {

    // ...other bluebase.js properties

    hooks: {
        'hook.event': {
            key: 'hook.listener.name',
            priority: 5,
            value: async (value, args, BR) => {
                // your hook logic here

                return value;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Register a hook through API

A single hook can be registered through the `BR.Hooks.register` function:

```typescript
await BB.Hooks.register({
  event: 'posts.edit',
  key: 'setEditedAt',
  value: async (post, { user }) => {
    post.editedAt = new Date();
    return post;
  }
});
```

It is also possible to register multiple hooks at once by using the `BR.Hooks.registerNestedCollection` function:

```typescript
await BB.Hooks.registerNestedCollection({
    'hook.event': [
        {
            key: 'hook.listener.name',
            priority: 5,
            value: async (value, args, BR) => {
                // your hook logic here

                return value;
            }
        },
        async (value, args, BR) => {
            // your hook logic here

            return value;
        }
    ]
});
```

## Unregistering a Hook

Hook Listeners can be unregistered through the `BR.Hooks.delete` function:

```typescript
BB.Hooks.delete('posts.edit', 'setEditedAt');
```

## Executing a Hook

Hooks are executed using the `BR.Hooks.run` function:

```typescript
modifier = await BR.Hooks.run(`movies.edit`, modifier, { document, currentUser });
```

In each case, the **first** argument is the key of the hook event, the **second** argument is the one iterated on by each filter function on the hook, while any remaining arguments are just passed along from one iteration to the next.

## Code Splitting

In BlueBase code splitting is done through treating certain objects as [BlueBaseModules](). The following can be BlueBaseModules:

### BR.Hooks.register method param

When registering a hook through `BR.Hooks.register` method, a module can be registered instead of a hook object.

```typescript
await BB.Hooks.register(import('./setEditedAtHook'));
```

But this method may not be as affective, as BlueBase needs to know a hook's key and event name at registration time. So this promise will be resolved immediately, even if the hook event \(e.g. `posts.edit`\) gets executed much later, or never at all. A much better way is to split just the handler function rather than the complete hook object:

### Handler function

It is possible to spilt a hook's handler function. This way the handler's bundle is only downloaded when the hook is executed.

This means that the code is not only **NOT** downloaded at boot time, and never at all if the hook is never executed.

```typescript
BB.Hooks.register({
  event: 'posts.edit',
  key: 'setEditedAt',
  value: import('./setEditedAtHookHandlerFn')
});
```

### Hook Collections

Each Hook in a Hook Collection is also evaluated as a BlueBaseModule:

```typescript
BB.Hooks.registerNestedCollection({
    'posts.create': [
        import('./setCreatedAtHook'),
        import('./setCreatedByHook'),
    ],
    'posts.edit': [
        import('./setEditedAtHook'),
        import('./setEditedByHook'),
    ],
});
```

As explained above, all these hooks will be evaluated at registration time, even if it is only the handler function. To avoid this, split only the handler functions instead:

```typescript
BB.Hooks.registerNestedCollection({
    'posts.create': [
        {
            key: 'set.created.at',
            priority: 5,
            value: import('./setCreatedAtHookFn')
        },
        {
            key: 'set.created.by',
            priority: 6,
            value: import('./setCreatedByHookFn')
        },
    ]
});
```
